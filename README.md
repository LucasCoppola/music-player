4. **Playlist and Library Management**:
   - Allow users to create, edit, and delete their own playlists.
   - Support sharing playlists with other users.
5. **Recommendations and Personalization**:
   - Implement a recommendation system based on listening history and user preferences.
   - Include features like "Recommended for You" and "Trending Tracks."
6. **Real-Time Features**:
   - Add real-time notifications for new releases or friends’ activity.
   - Implement live chat or collaborative playlists where users can listen together.
7. **Analytics and Reports**:
   - Provide analytics for track popularity, user activity, and listening patterns.
   - Generate reports for artists and admins about track performance and user engagement.
8. **API Integration**:
   - Integrate with third-party APIs for additional features like lyrics, music reviews, or album artwork.

### **Tech Stack:**

- **Backend**: NestJS for the server-side logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data, music tracks, playlists, etc.
- **Streaming**: Use a streaming service or implement your own using technologies like `ffmpeg` for processing audio.
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets or [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) for real-time features.

### **Implementation Tips:**

- **Structure**: Follow NestJS modular architecture to keep your code organized.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your service.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices like input validation, data encryption, and secure authentication.

This project can be as simple or complex as you want, depending on how many features you decide to implement. It’s a great way to dive deep into NestJS and build a useful application.
